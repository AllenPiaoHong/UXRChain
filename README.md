In this work, we designed a large language model driven multi-agent system UXRChain for efficient, sustainable, and low-cost web
user experience research. By simulating the real-world user experience research workflow, UXRChain can automatically and almost
cost-free complete a user experience study: i).Design appropriate research plans based on the provided UX questions, ii).Generate
simulated target users and organize them to test the studied web pages, iii).Execute and keep improving the research plan on the
simulated users, and iv).Automatically analyze the data collected from users to provide final reports.

# What you need to do ?

3. Change the task/task_test_json file to your website and research quesiton concerning the user experience.

4. Run the Agent/UXRAgent.py 

5. Wait for the user experiencce report !
